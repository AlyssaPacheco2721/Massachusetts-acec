# Massachusetts Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Analysis

This project analyzes **Massachusetts Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)** using the **MassGIS dataset (April 2009)**.  
Data preparation was performed in **QGIS**, while data cleaning and visualization were completed in **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**.  

The goal of the project is to explore **ACEC distribution, acreage, and designation trends** across the state, providing insights to support **conservation planning and environmental awareness**.

## Project Contents
- **/charts/** → PNG images of key visualizations
- **/maps/** → Exported map layouts (JPG) showing ACEC boundaries and spatial distribution across Massachusetts  
- **/data/** → Cleaned CSV or Excel tables used for analysis, including ACEC attribute table with processed fields for acreage, region, and designation dates  
- **/docs/** → Full project report in PDF format, including methodology, charts, maps, insights, and discussion of challenges and next steps

## Methodology
1. Imported the **MassGIS ACEC dataset (April 2009)** into QGIS for spatial preparation.  
2. Cleaned and inspected the attribute table in **Python (pandas)**, handling missing values.  
3. Verified spatial consistency and projection in **QGIS**.  
4. Generated visualizations in **Python (matplotlib, seaborn)**:
