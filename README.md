# Massachusetts Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Analysis

This project analyzes **Massachusetts Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)** using the **MassGIS dataset (April 2009)**.  
Data preparation was performed in **QGIS**, while data cleaning and visualization were completed in **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**.  

The goal of the project is to explore **ACEC distribution, acreage, and designation trends** across the state, providing insights to support **conservation planning and environmental awareness**.

## Methodology
1. Imported the **MassGIS ACEC dataset (April 2009)** into QGIS for spatial preparation.  
2. Cleaned and inspected the attribute table in **Python (pandas)**, handling missing values.  
3. Verified spatial consistency and projection in **QGIS**.  
4. Generated visualizations in **Python (matplotlib, seaborn)**: bar chart, scatter plot, line chart.  
5. Maintained version control and shared results via **GitHub**.
